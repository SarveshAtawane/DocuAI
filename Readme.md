# DocuAI | SaaS Application  

DocuAI is a SaaS platform designed to simplify the process of creating enterprise-grade chatbots. Developers can seamlessly integrate their websites and documents into a chatbot using a secure API key‚Äîno prior knowledge of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or Large Language Models (LLMs) is required.  

Users only need to upload their documents or provide website links, and DocuAI takes care of the rest. It automatically processes the documents and crawls the provided websites, including their sublinks, to extract and embed relevant content for semantic search and chatbot functionality.  

To start the project, run the following command:  
```bash
./runall.sh
```
